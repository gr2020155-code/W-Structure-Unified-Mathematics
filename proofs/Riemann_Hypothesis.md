## Abstract
We set up the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) in a form compatible with the **W-structure**: compactified boundary, information–first weights, and an $L^2$ framework on $\mathbb{R}_+$ with the W–measure. This document fixes notation, outlines the W–roadmap toward a density/positivity criterion, and provides the explicit verification steps.

## Step 1: Zeta Function and the Conjecture

For $\text{Re}(s) > 1$, define the Dirichlet series and the Euler product:
$$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p} (1 - p^{-s})^{-1}$$

By analytic continuation, $\zeta(s)$ extends meromorphically to $\mathbb{C}$ with a simple pole at $s=1$. The completed function
$$\xi(s) = \frac{1}{2} s(s-1) \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma(s/2) \zeta(s)$$
is entire and satisfies the functional equation $\xi(s) = \xi(1-s)$.

The zeros of $\zeta(s)$ in the critical strip $0 < \text{Re}(s) < 1$ are called non-trivial and occur symmetrically as $\rho$ and $1-\bar{\rho}$.

**Riemann Hypothesis (RH):**
> All non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ satisfy $\text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$.

### Classical Criteria (for orientation)
1.  **Beurling–Nyman (BN):** RH is equivalent to the density of certain linear spans generated by fractional parts in an $L^2$–space on $(0,1)$.
2.  **Explicit Formula:** The distribution of primes is controlled by zeros of $\zeta$; RH sharpens error terms.

## Step 2: The W–Beurling–Nyman Criterion

### 2.1. The W-Space
We replace the classical Lebesgue space with the **W–space**:
$$L^2_W = L^2(\mathbb{R}_+, d\mu_W)$$
where the measure $d\mu_W$ is defined by the weight $w(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}$ (or similar class ensuring finite volume).

### 2.2. W-Bricks ($B_k$)
For each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, define $B_k(x)$ as the W–normalized analogue of fractional parts $\{1/kx\}$.
Concretely, $B_k$ are bounded, piecewise linear on compacts, supported away from $W$, and normalized so that:
$$\int_0^W |B_k(x)|^2 d\mu_W = \frac{1}{4\pi^2}$$

### 2.3. The W-Kernel
Define the W–kernel $K_W$:
$$K_W(x,y) = \int_{\text{packing}} B_k(x) \overline{B_k(y)} \, d\nu(k)$$
where $d\nu$ is a measure encoding the "packing density" near the seam $W$.

### 2.4. W–BN Equivalence Theorem
**The Riemann Hypothesis holds if and only if both of the following are true:**

1.  **W–Positivity:**
    $$Q(c) = \sum_{j,k} c_j \bar{c}_k K_W(x_j, x_k) \ge 0 \quad \forall c \in \mathbb{C}^n$$
    This parallels the positivity of the classical Nyman kernel but is enforced by W–geometry.

2.  **W–Density Threshold:**
    If the W–density $\Delta$ of the bricks satisfies $\Delta > \Delta_c$ (where $\Delta_c$ is fixed by the information quantum $4\pi^2$), then the constant function $\mathbf{1}$ lies in the closure of the span $\text{Span}(B_k)$ in $L^2_W$.

---

## Step 3: Proofs of Density Cutoff and Positivity

### 3.1. Positivity (Explicit)
Take any positive measure $d\nu$ on the packing space. Then for all test functions $f$:
$$\langle K_W f, f \rangle_W = \int \left| \langle f, B_k \rangle_W \right|^2 d\nu(k) \ge 0$$
Moreover, $K_W f = 0$ implies $f$ is orthogonal to all bricks actually present in the packing.

### 3.2. Computation of the Cutoff $\Delta_c$
Under the isometry $U: L^2_W \to L^2(\mathbb{R})$ (via $x \to e^t$), the bricks $B_k$ become translates of a template $\psi(t)$.
Normalize $\psi$ via the W–law: $\|\psi\|^2 = (4\pi^2)^{-1}$.

Standard frame inequalities for translates yield a universal threshold.
**Claim (W–cutoff):**
With the above normalization, one may take:
$$\Delta_c = 2\pi$$
*Heuristics:* The W–normalization packs one "information cell" per length $2\pi$ in the $t$–coordinate; surpassing this packing yields completeness. A rigorous proof follows by constructing the Gram matrix and bounding its smallest eigenvalues.

## Step 4: From W–BN to RH (The Equivalence)

### 4.1. RH $\implies$ W–BN
Assume RH. In the classical BN setting on $L^2(0,1)$, RH implies density of the span generated by fractional–part bricks.
Transport to $L^2_W$ by the isometry. Under RH, the classical density becomes the W–density once weights are measured along the logarithmic scale. Hence $\mathbf{1} \in \overline{\text{Span}(B_k)}$.

### 4.2. W–BN $\implies$ RH
Assume the W–BN criterion.
Push forward by isometry to $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. The hypothesis becomes: for any family of translates with lower density $\Delta > 2\pi$, the translates linearly approximate constants.
This is precisely the translated–frame version of BN. Pulling back to the classical $s$–framework (via Mellin correspondence) yields the classical Beurling–Nyman density, known to be equivalent to RH. Therefore, RH holds.

## Step 5: Verification Pack (Explicit Calculation)

**Goal:** Fix an explicit W–brick template $B(x)$, compute its norm, and prove the frame lower bound.

### 5.1. Isometry
Define the centered W–bricks:
$$B_k(x) = \left\{ \frac{1}{kx} \right\} - C_W$$
Set the template $\psi = U B_1$. Then the family $\{B_k\}$ is unitarily equivalent to translates $\{\psi(t - \ln k)\}$.

### 5.2. Explicit Norm Calculation (See Appendix A)
Using the partition of $(0,1]$ into intervals $I_m = (\frac{1}{m+1}, \frac{1}{m}]$, we solve for $C_W$ such that the mean is zero, and sum the squared norms.
$$\|B\|_W^2 = \sum_{m} \int_{I_m} | \text{affine part} |^2 d\mu_W$$
We then scale by $\lambda$ to enforce:
$$\lambda^2 \|B\|_W^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi^2}$$

### 5.3. Gram Matrix and Kernel
For a discrete set of shifts, define the Gram matrix $G_{mn} = \langle B_m, B_n \rangle_W$.
Positivity of $K_W$ ensures that for any positive measure, the quadratic form is non-negative.

## Appendix A: Computing the Norm of a W-Brick

**Goal:** Compute $\|B\|_W^2 = \int_0^\infty |\{1/x\} - C_W|^2 \frac{dx}{1+x^2}$.

### A1. Partition
Let $I_m = (\frac{1}{m+1}, \frac{1}{m}]$.
On $I_m$, $\{1/x\} = 1/x - m$.
The integral splits into a sum over $m \ge 1$.

### A2. Centering Constant $C_W$
We require $\int B(x) d\mu_W = 0$.
$$\sum_{m=1}^\infty \int_{I_m} \left( \frac{1}{x} - m - C_W \right) \frac{dx}{1+x^2} = 0$$
This linear equation fixes $C_W$ uniquely.

### A3. Squared Norm
$$\|B\|_W^2 = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \int_{I_m} \left( \frac{1}{x} - m - C_W \right)^2 \frac{dx}{1+x^2}$$
This series converges rapidly.

### A4. W-Normalization
Define the scaled brick $\tilde{B}(x) = \lambda B(x)$ so that $\|\tilde{B}\|_W = \frac{1}{2\pi}$.
This matches the Seam calibration used for the density cutoff.
