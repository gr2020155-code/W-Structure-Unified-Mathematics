## 1. The Definition of Charge in W-Structure

Standard physics treats elementary charge $e$ as an empirical constant. In W-Structure, charge is a **derived geometric property** of the node's topological winding.

**Charge ($q$) is the Chirality (Orientation) of the Information Flow on the Seam.**

* **Positive ($+$):** Right-handed winding relative to the global W-field.
* **Negative ($-$):** Left-handed winding.
* **Neutral ($0$):** Compensated winding (closed self-loop).

## 2. The Exact Calculation Formula

In the file `g_minus_2.md`, we established that the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ is a fixed geometric packing invariant of the W-seam:
$$\alpha_{geom} \approx 0.00729735257...$$

The elementary charge $e$ is the **Flux Amplitude** generated by this geometric asymmetry. In the natural units of the W-Structure (where geometric coupling is unity), the exact relation is derived from the vacuum permittivity of the lattice:

$$e^2 = 4\pi \cdot \alpha_{geom}$$

Thus, the exact value of the elementary charge is:
$$e_{W} = \sqrt{4\pi \cdot \alpha_{geom}}$$

### 2.1. Numerical Value (W-Units)
Substituting the geometric invariant $\alpha_{geom}$:
$$e_{W} \approx \sqrt{4\pi \cdot 0.00729735...} \approx 0.302822...$$
This dimensionless number represents the **coupling strength** of a single topological twist to the global information field.

## 3. The Topological Selection Rule (Existence)

Why do some particles have charge and others do not?
As defined in **Verification Pack v2**, the existence of charge is strictly governed by the parity of the winding numbers $(p, q)$ in the mass equation $N = 2^s p q$.

**The Parity Rule:**
$$\text{Charge exists} \iff (p - q) \text{ is ODD}$$

* **Odd Parity ($(p-q) \pmod 2 \neq 0$):** The knot topology is asymmetric (Chiral). It generates a non-zero flux with orientation $\pm 1$.
    * *Examples:* Electron, Proton, Muon.
* **Even Parity ($(p-q) \pmod 2 = 0$):** The knot is topologically symmetric. The windings compensate each other, resulting in zero net flux (Chirality 0).
    * *Examples:* Neutrino, Neutron (internal compensation).

Thus, charge is quantized not just in magnitude ($e_W$), but in existence ($\{0, 1\}$).

## 4. Universality (Electron vs. Proton)

This explains why the heavy Proton and light Electron have exactly the same charge magnitude.

* **Electron ($m=1$):** Single loop, Odd Parity. Chirality $-1$. Charge $= -e_W$.
* **Proton ($m=3$):** Triple loop, Odd Parity. Chirality $+1$. Charge $= +e_W$.

**Charge depends only on the Orientation and Parity of the knot, not on its Volume ($N$).**

## 5. Summary

1.  **Magnitude:** Fixed strictly by the geometric constant $\alpha_{geom}$ ($e = \sqrt{4\pi \alpha_{geom}}$).
2.  **Existence:** Governed by the topological selection rule `odd(p-q)`.
3.  **Invariance:** Identical for all chiral nodes regardless of mass.
