# Phase Transitions: From Information to Mass

**Subject:** Mechanism of Matter Genesis
**Status:** Fundamental Logic
**Key Principle:** Mass is a Phase of Information (Not a separate substance)

## 1. Core Principle

In the W-structure, mass and energy are **not separate substances** but stable phases of informational condensation. Between pure information and stabilized matter, there exists a continuous sequence of intermediate states. These phases determine how information becomes observable as energy, radiation, and inertia.

**Crucial Topologic Rule:**
No new cells appear inside already coherent regions of space. Existing cells **evolve through phase transitions**, changing their internal informational state while preserving topological continuity. Space grows only at the Universal Front; the interior only matures.

## 2. The Four Principal Phases

| Phase | Description | Dominant Feature | Time Metric | Physical Analogue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Informational** | Pure potential; minimal chaos. | Logical Coherence | Logarithmic | Vacuum layer, Reserve ($f_{res}$) |
| **II. Proto-energetic** | Local fluctuations; coherence modulates. | Phase Dynamics | Quasi-logarithmic | Zero-point field, Virtual particles |
| **III. Energetic** | Stable oscillatory exchange. | Wave-like Order | Linear | Radiation, Fields, Photons |
| **IV. Mass** | Full localization; chaos saturation. | Static Condensation | Asymptotically Slow | Matter, Baryons ($f_{active}$) |

Each transition corresponds to a **partial loss of reversibility**: information becomes constrained, gaining the appearance of "hard" reality.

## 3. Evolution of a Cell

A spatial cell evolves follows the sequence:
$$I \rightarrow E_p \rightarrow E \rightarrow M$$
This connects directly to the **PAN-Decomposition**:
* **Phases I & II** constitute the **Informational Reserve** ($\approx 90\%$, Dark Sector).
* **Phase IV** constitutes the **Active Fraction** ($\approx 10\%$, Baryonic Sector).

## 4. The Mechanism of Redshift (Phase Drift)

Light corresponds to **Phase III** — the transmission of oscillatory states through the medium.
Because no new cells are created between the emitter and observer, the distance is topologically fixed. However, the **Medium Itself** is evolving (maturing from Phase I to IV).

**The Redshift Origin:**
It is not the scattering of galaxies (Doppler) nor the stretching of rubber-space (Metric Expansion).
It is **Phase Drift**.
$$\frac{\nu_{obs}}{\nu_{emit}} = e^{-3\lambda_{eff} \Delta t / t_{min}}$$
The signal loses energy because it must propagate through a medium that is becoming "denser" (more phase-saturated) over time. This confirms the "Vacuum Viscosity" model proposed in the JWST resolution.

## 5. Physical Consequences

1.  **Unity of Substance:** There is only Information. Mass is simply information that has been "braked" to a standstill (Phase IV).
2.  **Conservation of Topology:** The prohibition on creating new cells inside a closed loop ensures Causal Stability.
3.  **Nature of Vacuum:** The vacuum is not empty; it is a Phase I/II ocean of potential, holding the $90\%$ reserve mass of the Universe.
