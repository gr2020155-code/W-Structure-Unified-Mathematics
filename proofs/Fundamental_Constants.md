# Reduction Map of Physical Constants in W-Structure

**Subject:** Origin of Fundamental Constants
**Status:** Reduced to Geometry
**Key Principle:** Constants are not axiomatic inputs, but geometric outputs.

## 1. The Fundamental Level: Informational Invariant

In the Standard Model, constants like $c$, $\hbar$, $G$, and $\alpha$ are empirical parameters measured from experiments.
In **W-Structure**, there is only **one** input: the geometry of the Informational Seam. All "constants" are derivative properties of the Information Quantum $K_w$ and the discrete topology.

## 2. The Reduction Map

| Constant | Symbol | Classical Status | W-Structure Status | Definition / Origin |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Information Quantum** | $K_w$ | N/A | **Fundamental** | The single invariant ($4\pi^2$ or $\pi^2$) defining the capacity of a W-cell. |
| **Fine-Structure** | $\alpha$ | Empirical ($\approx 1/137$) | **Geometric** | Dimensionless invariant of packing density on the Seam (Asymmetry of Information Flow). |
| **Speed of Light** | $c$ | Fundamental Speed | **Ratio** | Ratio of spatial ($l_W$) and temporal ($t_W$) discrete scales. Unit conversion factor. |
| **Planck's Constant** | $\hbar$ | Action Quantum | **Scaling** | The converter $\sigma$ that translates "nats" (information) into "Joules $\cdot$ seconds" (action). |
| **Gravitational Constant** | $G$ | Gravity Strength | **Emergent** | Emerges from the discrete mass spectrum and the curvature of the W-manifold. |
| **Particle Masses** | $m_e, m_\mu, \dots$ | Higgs Coupling | **Discrete Spectrum** | Eigenvalues of the W-Operator. Fully defined by integer winding indices $(p, q)$ and $K_w$. |

## 3. The Hierarchy of Derivation

1.  **Level 0 (Geometry):**
    $$K_w = 4\pi^2$$
    This establishes the topology of the closed loop (Seam).

2.  **Level 1 (Flow):**
    $$\alpha = \alpha_{geom}(K_w)$$
    The flow of information on this topology creates a characteristic asymmetry, which we measure as the electromagnetic coupling $\alpha$.

3.  **Level 2 (Scale):**
    $$c = \frac{l_W}{t_W}, \quad \hbar = \text{Action}(1 \text{ nat})$$
    These set the "pixel size" and "refresh rate" of the physical simulation.

4.  **Level 3 (Mass & Force):**
    $$m = f(p, q, K_w)$$
    $$G \sim \text{curvature per unit mass}$$
    Particles and Gravity appear as the inevitable result of stressing the geometric grid.

## 4. Conclusion

Physics does not need 26 arbitrary constants.
It needs **One Geometric Structure**.
By fixing the W-Structure, we automatically fix the values of $\alpha$, $c$, $\hbar$, and the mass spectrum.

**There are no free parameters in the Universe.**
