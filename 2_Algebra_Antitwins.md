# Part II: Algebra of Antitwins

**Subject:** Operational Rules at the Boundary
**Genesis:** The topological identity of Origin and Limit.

## 1. The Antitwin Relation ($0 \leftrightarrow W$)

In the W-topology, the "Zero Layer" (0) and the "Seam" ($W$) are not opposite ends of a linear scale. They are the **same node** in the compactified loop (like a figure-eight knot).

* **0:** The state of potential (Empty).
* **W:** The state of saturation (Full).

This implies the **Antitwin Principle**:
> Any operation involving the Seam resolves into the set $\{0, W\}$.

## 2. Operational Rules

Standard arithmetic fails at the boundary because it lacks the concept of a "saturation point". W-Algebra provides strict results derived from geometry.

Let $C$ be a finite constant.

### Multiplication (Absorption)
The Seam absorbs finite values.
$$C \cdot W = W$$

### Division (The Antitwin Set)
Division by the Seam is path-dependent. It collapses the value to the boundary set.
$$\frac{C}{W} \in \{0, W\}$$
*Interpretation:* Depending on the trajectory, the result is either a reset to Potential (0) or a merge with the Limit ($W$).

### Power Laws (Saturation)
$$1^W \in \{0, W\}$$
The "indeterminate form" of calculus is resolved. A unit value, when "inflated" to the global scale, either vanishes or saturates the field.

## 3. Logical Necessity

These rules are not arbitrary. They prevent the generation of "NaN" (Not a Number) errors in the operating system of reality. Every calculation must return a valid state: either finite, 0, or $W$.
